 <h1>Talis Platform Client</h1>
 
 <p>Pho is a Ruby client for the <a href="http://www.talis.com/platform">Talis Platform</a> <a href="http://n2.talis.com/wiki/Platform_API">API</a>. The API provides 
 access to a semantic web data store capable of storing unstructured data (i.e. binary streams) as well as structured data (as RDF).</p>
 
 <p>
 Pho provides a client-side API suitable for working with the Platform API. The code is largely a thin wrapper around the underlying HTTP calls, as well as 
 a set of convenience classes and methods for parsing and working with responses from the Platform. The goal is to provide a complete API that also deals with 
 RDF updates and mapping to/from Ruby objects.

 <p>Currently the best source of documentation is the <a href="rdoc/index.html">rdocs</a>.</p>
 
 <p>There are also some <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/n2/archives/tag/pho">blog posts on the Platform developer blog</a> that illustrate use of the Pho API and command-line client.</p>
 
 <p>As of version 0.7.4 <a href="http://github.com/ldodds/pho"></a>the source code is managed in github</a>.</p>
