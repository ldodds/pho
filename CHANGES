  dc:title and dcterms:title are both added to store config
   
* Added FieldPredicateMap.add_mapping

== Version 0.7.4

* Moved version control to github.
* Added store.name property

* At suggestion of @chrislowis added rescue around redland dependent requires.
* talis_store command-line now supports "upload" option for storing individual files or directories
* Added support for directory traversal to RDFManager and FileManager classes
* Fixed bug in counting files being managed in RDFManager
